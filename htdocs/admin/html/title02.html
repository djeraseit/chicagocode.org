Such rules may provide for lists by area or location, by department or other agency, for removal of those not available for or refusing employment, for minimum and maximum duration of such lists, and for such other provisions as may be necessary to provide rapid and satisfactory service to the operating agencies.

The charges and explanation of evidence need not be in any particular form, but must be sufficient to apprise the employee of the matters on which discipline may be based. The employee's response must be reviewed by the department head or designee responsible for making the decision, provided that such designee may not be the person who initiated the charges against the employee. No permanent employee in the career service may be discharged, demoted or suspended for more than 30 days unless the statement of charges and any matters in support are first reviewed by the departments of law and human resources, before the employee is notified of such action;</p>

The human resources board, any of its members, or a hearing officer appointed by the board may administer oaths and secure by subpoena both the evidence and witnesses for the production of relevant books and papers. All proceedings before the board, a member thereof, or the hearing officer shall be recorded. The findings and decision of a member of the board or hearing officer shall be certified to the human resources board, which may accept or reject the findings and decision or may require further hearing before the board. After the board accepts the findings and decision of its member or hearing officer, or after a hearing by the human resources board, it shall certify the findings and decision to the commissioner of human resources who shall then notify the appropriate appointing authority. Nothing in this section limits the power of the appointing authority or his/her designee to take disciplinary action against a subordinate pursuant to the rules of the department of human resources.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Appeals by an employee of discharge, demotion or suspension for a period exceeding 30 days shall be governed by the following procedure:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(a)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The employee shall be given written notice of the disciplinary decision by the department head or designee. The employee may appeal the department head's or designee's decision to the personnel board by making a written request therefor within five calendar days of the effective date of discipline. An appeal shall not affect the effective date of discipline. The written notice must contain the following statement:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>If you desire a hearing on this disciplinary action, you must file a written request for the hearing with the Personnel Board of the City of Chicago, Room 1100, City Hall, Chicago, Illinois.

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(b)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>If the employee requests a hearing, a date therefor shall be set, not more than 45 days following receipt of the request for hearing by the personnel board.

The personnel board shall render a decision on the appeal not more than 60 calendar days after the close of the hearing. If the time limitations provided for herein are not met, the employee shall be entitled prospectively to the pay and benefits of the position held before the imposition of suspension or discharge, or in the case of a demotion the difference in pay between the former and current position, beginning with the first day after the failure to meet the time limit, pending decision of the personnel board, but the employee shall have no right to be reinstated except by order of the personnel board. The personnel board shall file a written report in all cases where a discharged, demoted or suspended employee becomes entitled to the pay and benefits of his or her former position prospectively by reason of failure to meet a time limit. The report shall be filed with the committee on finance and the city clerk within 21 days of the failure to meet a time limit, and shall contain the causes and circumstances of such failure. Nothing herein shall deprive the personnel board of jurisdiction to decide the merits of the disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(c)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>An employee whose discipline is not upheld shall receive full backpay for any period when he or she was off work, or serving in a lower position, less any lesser disciplinary action imposed by the board. Said employee shall be reinstated to his or her position or such lower position as determined by the board, upon notification of the board's decision, or following such lesser discipline as may be imposed by the board, as appropriate.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The bidder shall complete the canvassing formula and transfer the final award criteria figure, line 15, to the space provided on the itemized proposal sheet. A contract in the amount of the total base bid will be awarded to the responsible bidder with the lowest award criteria figure. The city reserves the right to revise all arithmetic calculations for correctness. The contractor is obliged during the construction of the project to fulfill every numerical commitment made under the canvassing formula categories. Therefore, every limiting condition or circumstance which may affect referral, hiring, or deployment of construction trades employees must be taken into account by the bidder before the commitment is proposed. Limits imposed by the policies or circumstances of labor organizations or other referral resources, for example, should be anticipated by the bidder, since relief from the contractor's obligations as established under the canvassing formula is not available due to such circumstances found to exist during construction. Also, if journeyworkers will not be employed in the project, or apprentices, or laborers, then the proposal made in the appropriate lines, lines 2 and 8, or lines 4 and 10 or 6 and 12, should be entered as “0 percent”, since no journeyworker or apprentice or laborer hours are reported after construction, this will be computed by the city as 0 percent minority/female hours achieved. If commitments are made in the apprentice category, lines 4 and 10, the total apprentice hours to be employed on the project should be anticipated to be a substantial number of hours; since it is the intention of the city that where a commitment for a percentage of minority or female apprentices has been made, the percentage may be counted as fulfilled only as long as there were provided at least 40 hours of minority or female employment as apprentices. For this reason, where a minority or female percentage commitment has been made, if in the final audit of the performance of the contract there are less than 40 minority or female apprentice hours counted, then the number of minority or female apprentice hours will be counted by the City as “0" for the purpose of measuring the achievement towards the apprentice canvassing formula goal.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Therefore, notice that when the contractor is performing at a level under a minority or female apprentice goal, line 4 or line 10 above, the contractor will be subject to the full amount of liquidated damages, see lines 5 and 11, if at least 40 hours of minority or female apprenticeship are not achieved. When the bidder foresees that this minimum amount of apprenticeship is not available to the project, then “0" should be put in lines 4 and 10 as the percentage commitment for apprentices.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The contractor is obligated to meet the total commitment made in each category, subject to liquidated damages as described below for noncompliance. The contractor hereby consents and agrees that, in the event of failure to comply with each of the minimum commitments submitted with the proposal on lines 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 of the canvassing formula, covering journeyworkers, apprentices, and laborers, respectively, the following shall apply to determine a monetary sum to be withheld from the final payment to the contractor.</p>

In making his annual designation of target market contracts, the chief procurement officer shall attempt to vary the included procurements so that a variety of goods and services produced by different M.B.E.'s and W.B.E.'s shall be set aside each year. M.B.E.'s and W.B.E.'s shall remain eligible to seek the procurement award of contracts which have not been designated as target market contracts.</p>

D.P.S. may make participation in the target market program dependent upon submission to stricter compliance audits than are generally applicable to participants in the program. No contract shall be eligible for inclusion in the target market program unless the list developed by D.P.S. indicates that there are at least three qualified M.B.E.s or W.B.E.s interested in participating in that type of contract. D.P.S. may develop guidelines to regulate the level of participation of individual M.B.E.s and W.B.E.s in the target market program in order to prevent the domination of the target market program by a small number of such entities. Where necessary or useful, D.P.S. may require M.B.E.s and W.B.E.s to participate in training programs offered by the department of housing and economic development* or other city departments or agencies as a condition to participation in the target market program.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The City Council, after considering evidence presented to the Budget Committee, including evidence presented at trial in Builders Association of Greater Chicago v. City of Chicago, Number 96 C 1122 (N.D. Ill.), during May and June 2003 (the “B.A.G.C. Trial”); statistical evidence, not available during the B.A.G.C. Trial, of continuing discrimination against Blacks, Hispanics and women in the Chicago construction marketplace; the report of the Mayoral Task Force on M.B.E./W.B.E. as well as additional anecdotal evidence of discrimination against minorities and women in the Chicago construction marketplace; and the testimony of experts and anecdotal witnesses; and receiving and considering written reports and submissions, adopts the following findings as a strong basis in evidence supporting a narrowly tailored, remedial affirmative action program in city construction contracting:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(a)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>the City of Chicago seeks to provide a level playing field and equal access for all contractors and subcontractors to participate in city contracting opportunities;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(b)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>the city has a significant impact upon the area economy through its contracting functions;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(c)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>prior to the adoption of Executive Order 85-2, city contracting often operated as a closed shop, such that minorities and women received fewer than the number of city contracts and subcontractors and contract and subcontract awards than would have been expected absent discrimination;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(d)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>city departments reduced the disparities between the availability of minority and women firms and their utilization by implementing Executive Order 85-2;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(e)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>the city engaged in a substantial good faith legislative effort in 1990, involving 18 days of hearings and debate, which identified strong historical, statistical, scholarly and anecdotal evidence of past and present discriminatory practices in the Chicago-area market, including but not limited to construction, which placed minorities and women in a position of social and economic disadvantage and imposed discriminatory barriers to the entry and continued viability of minorities and women in the Chicago market and to their participation on city contracts;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(f)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>based on the strong evidence presented during the hearings, the City Council on July 31, 1990, enacted an affirmative action ordinance designed to remedy discrimination in city contracting against minorities and women;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(g)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>the Builders Association of Greater Chicago challenged the constitutionality of Sections 2-92-420 through 2-92-570 in 1996, as applied to construction contracts;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(h)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>strong evidence was introduced at the B.A.G.C. Trial that past and current discriminatory practices continue to place racial and ethnic minorities and women in a position of social and economic disadvantage, limiting opportunities for them to form and control construction businesses, as well as reducing the level and availability of employment opportunities for minorities and women in the trade unions which serve the Chicago construction marketplace;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(i)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>strong evidence was introduced at the B.A.G.C. Trial that such current and past discriminatory practices, and the continuing effects of such discrimination, have impeded the growth and success of the businesses which minorities and women do form, as well as the level and availability of the employment opportunities in the construction trade unions;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(j)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>the evidence at the B.A.G.C. Trial demonstrated that these discriminatory practices include direct and indirect racial, ethnic and gender slurs and harassment; discrimination by lending institutions and other sources of capital; reduced opportunities for minority and women subcontractors to bid or quote to majority prime contractors; exclusion from and discriminatory treatment by the construction trade unions; exclusion from business and professional networks critical to entrepreneurial success; and discrimination by surety bonding companies, insurance companies and other entities integral to the contracting marketplace;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(k)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>following the B.A.G.C. Trial, Judge James B. Moran held that the city has a compelling interest in implementing a remedial race- and gender-conscious affirmative action program in the Chicago construction market, but that the city's 1990 ordinance is insufficiently narrowly tailored in 2003 as applied to construction;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(l)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>there is ample availability of ready, willing and able minority- and women-owned firms to participate in city and private sector construction contracting and subcontracting opportunities;</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(n)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>minority and women workers' participation in the relevant construction marketplace declined from 1980 to 1990;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(o)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>other jurisdictions, including Cook County, Illinois, have experienced drastic reductions in minority and women business participation, to less than their availability, after race- and gender-conscious remedial measures were terminated;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(p)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>while the city has made substantial progress in its efforts to ameliorate discrimination in its own construction contracting practices, private companies that contract on public projects continue to discriminate against minorities and women, and as a result of this discrimination, the city has been in the past a passive participant in a system of discrimination against minorities and women in the Chicago construction marketplace, and, in the absence of programs to eliminate such discrimination, would continue to be a passive participant in such a system;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(q)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>the city has a compelling interest in preventing its tax dollars from perpetuating a market so flawed by past discrimination that it restricts existing minority- and women-owned businesses from unfettered competition in the Chicago construction market;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(r)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>the city has a compelling interest in not having its construction projects return to near monopoly domination by white male firms, as was the case prior to Executive Order 85-2 and the city's current affirmative action program in procurement;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(s)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>although the city has undertaken since 1990 a variety of race- and gender-neutral measures such as technical assistance and small business loan programs, such programs have not been sufficient to ameliorate the effects of racial and gender discrimination in the construction marketplace;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(t)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>evidence at the B.A.G.C. Trial demonstrated that flexible race- and gender-conscious remedial measures do not overly burden construction firms owned by majority males;</p>

The city council further finds that it is necessary to promote peace and good order and to eliminate such prejudice and discrimination by establishing an agency that will investigate complaints of discrimination, enforce civil rights ordinances, and promote harmony and understanding among various segments of society by gathering information on matters of human relations and providing education and counseling thereon to the various agencies of city government and to interested groups and individuals.

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The following Resolution was adopted by the city council on March 28, 1956 (Coun. J. p. 2421):</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>WHEREAS, The City of Chicago, being the county seat of Cook County, Illinois, has become the second largest city in the nation; and</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>WHEREAS, The increased activities on the part of both the citizen and his local government have created an urgent need for modern public buildings and facilities so that government services can be conducted efficiently and economically; and</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>WHEREAS, Many of the present public buildings now used to service the people are outgrown, outmoded and greatly overcrowded; and</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>WHEREAS, The City of Chicago, to meet the needs of a growing population, has been compelled to expend large sums of money annually in the rental, operation and maintenance of additional building space to house the various branches, departments and divisions of government; and</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>WHEREAS, The dispersement of the departments and agencies of government causes confusion and considerable waste of time and effort for citizens doing business with government; and</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>WHEREAS, Many public records, wills, conveyances, vital statistics, court decrees, and other similar documents in use in the conduct of daily business are now filed in poorly protected and overcrowded spaces, and in widely separated locations because of the lack of adequate public buildings; and</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>WHEREAS, The cause of good government will be served if modern buildings, centrally located, were constructed for the various governmental agencies of the City of Chicago;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved, That there is need and it is in the best interest of the public that a public building commission be organized to exercise the powers and authority prescribed by “An Act to authorize the creation of Public Building Commissions and to define their rights, powers, and duties”, enacted by the 69th General Assembly of the State of Illinois, and there is hereby created the public building commission of Chicago. The mayor shall, within ten days after the date of the adoption of this resolution, cause a copy of the resolution to be published once in a daily newspaper published in the City of Chicago, being the county seat of Cook County, Illinois. The mayor is authorized to take all other necessary action as provided by law in order to perfect said commission.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Be It Further Resolved, That the public building commission adopt as minimum performance standards the most recent ASHRAE/IES standard energy efficiency guidelines for all new public buildings; and</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Be It Further Resolved, That the taxing authorities seeking funding through public building commission bonds adopt these same most recent ASHRAE/IES standard energy efficiency guidelines as minimum standards; and</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Be It Further Resolved, That the public building commission provide projected energy budgets for all new buildings to the Chicago City Council Committee on Health and Environmental Protection; and</p>

Because many of these parcels are of minimal value, yet are costly for the city to clean up and maintain, it is in the city's best interest to convey certain of these parcels to the adjacent residential property owners so that they can be beautified or otherwise maintained. The conveyance of these parcels to adjacent residential property owners will return the parcels to the tax rolls and enhance the quality of life in the city's neighborhoods. For these reasons, it is the city's intention to establish by this ordinance a program, known as the adjacent neighbors land acquisition program (“A.N.L.A.P.”), to dispose of certain city-owned parcels of vacant real property.</p>
