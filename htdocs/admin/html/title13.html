Indirect ownership or control includes ownership or control by spouses (unless legally separated or divorced), children or adopted children; ownership of 50 percent or more of the stock of a corporation which owns an interest in the realty and ownership of a proportionate interest in a partnership or trust which owns an interest in the realty. For purposes of this section, a cooperative building is defined as a multiple-dwelling complex owned by a cooperative corporation, stock in which affords the owner thereof the right to possess or occupy a particular family unit allocated to that stock within the complex. This right of possession or occupancy is granted through a proprietary lease or similar arrangement, and, unlike the owner of a condominium, the owner of the cooperative stock does not hold legal title to his or her individual family unit.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>E-2a.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Nature of Tests.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>E-2a.(1).<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Brightness. Brightness tests shall be conducted on the material for the purpose of determining the discharge characteristic and to determine the period of useful life. Intensity of brightness shall be measured in accordance with the brightness requirements of paragraphs D-1 and D-2 to determine the characteristics of the material as received and after the weathering tests. (See paragraph E-2b (2)).</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>E-2a(2).<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Weathering.

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>E-2b.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Methods of Test.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>E-2b.(1). Brightness. The brightness of luminescent materials covered by this specification shall be determined by the visual comparison method. This method consists of matching the brightness of a diffusely illuminated field of known brightness with the brightness of the surface under test, the brightness of the diffuse field being capable of being varied at will. The brightness of the diffuse field shall be determined by preliminary calibration against known primary standards of brightness. Thus, by comparing the brightness of the working standard with the brightness of the surface under test, its value in microlamberts can be determined. For the measurement of brightness of 1.5 microlambert or above, a MacBeth illuminometer or other suitable photometer, fitted with an optical filter of the proper color and density to match the color of luminescent radiation, shall be used. For lower brightness, the instrument described in paragraph E-2b (1)a shall be used.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>E-2b.(1)a. Measurement of Brightness of Phosphorescence. Test equipment:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>MacBeth illuminometer or other suitable photometer. 1,000-watt tungsten projector lamp operating at rated voltage of 110 volts. The lamp need not be new but should be capable of furnishing 600 footcandles at a distance of one and one-half feet.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Test Specimens:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>In applied form shall have an area of at least one square foot.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Test procedure:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>After having been kept in darkness for a period of 24 hours prior to test, the test specimen shall be irradiated by 500 footcandles of tungsten illumination for a period of one minute. After irradiation, brightness readings shall be taken one minute after exposure and thereafter at the end of approximately 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180 minutes, etc., after exposure. Readings shall be taken by an observer whose eyes have been dark- adapted for a period of at least 20 minutes.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Low brightness measurements:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The photometer shall be used for brightness measurements below 1.5 microlambert. In this instrument the photometric field is approximately two and one-half inches in diameter and is observed with binocular vision. The photometer shall be calibrated by placing a diffusing surface of known reflection power and illuminating it to a known brightness by varying the distance from a source of the desired color. The brightness of the source shall be determined close to the source of high levels of illumination by standard methods of photometry. The results obtained from a series of measurements of brightness of phosphorescent decay shall be plotted.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Test equipment:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>A salt-spray chamber containing a sunlamp and “Corex window” assembly, equipped with a new S-1 bulb for each 22 cycle test.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>A pump for forcing a stream of water against a rapidly rotating disk within the chamber.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>A salt dissolver.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>A motor-driven blower for forcing heated air into the chamber. Test procedure:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The spray is produced when a stream of water strikes the rotating disk. The “Corex” window shall be located directly above the disk so that the spray will wash the window and prevent the accumulation of salt due to evaporation of water caused by the head of the sunlamp. The specimen shall be mounted inside the chamber so that the plane of the specimen is 12 inches from the bottom of the bulb. The specimen shall then be subjected to a cycle of ten minutes spray of five percent salt solution and then a 10-minute blast of air at 140 degrees Fahrenheit. These conditions shall alternate for 10-minute intervals over the required test period. During the test period the samples shall be continuously irradiated with ultraviolet light from the S-1 sunlamp.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>E-3.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Inspection Tests (at Place of Manufacture).

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>E-4.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Inspection Tests (at Designated Laboratory).
