<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The term “nonpossessory lease” means a lease or rental wherein use but not possession of the personal property is transferred and includes, but is not limited to, leased time on or use of any and all personal property not otherwise itself rented, such as leased time on or for the use of addressing machines, billboards, calculators, computers, computer software, copying equipment or data processing equipment, whether the time is fully or partially utilized, and specifically includes a “nonpossessory computer lease”.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The term “nonpossessory computer lease” means a nonpossessory lease in which the customer obtains access to the provider's computer and uses the computer and its software to input, modify or retrieve data or information, in each case without the intervention (other than de minimis intervention) of personnel acting on behalf of the provider. The term “nonpossessory computer lease” includes, but is not limited to, time sharing or time or other use of a computer with other users. In the case of a nonpossessory computer lease, the location of the terminal or other device by which a user accesses the computer shall be deemed to be the place of lease or rental and the place of use of the computer for purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The words “lease” or “rental” shall not be construed to include an agreement which constitutes a bona fide conditional sale of personal property. The primary consideration in determining whether an agreement is a conditional sale rather than a lease or rental is whether the lessee under the agreement both is required to make payments the sum of which is at least equal to the lessor's cost of the personal property and, under the terms of the agreement, has the option of taking title to or ownership of the personal property for nominal or no consideration after all payments required under the agreement have been made.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The words “lease” or “rental” shall not be construed to include an agreement which grants certain rights to a person, or the person's agent, to install, remove, operate, improve and maintain, and collect fees from, certain designated parking meters pursuant to a concession agreement.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The words “lease” or “rental” shall include a transfer of the use of software within the meaning of this chapter only if, for purposes of the Illinois Retailers' Occupation Tax and Illinois Use Tax, the software is not “custom” software and the transfer is an exempt license of software.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>J.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Lease or rental payment period” means the length of time or period of use that is covered by a single lease or rental payment as agreed to under the terms of the lease or rental agreement.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>K.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Lease price” or “rental price” means the consideration for the lease or rental of personal property, valued in money, whether received in money or otherwise, including cash, credits, property and services, determined without any deduction for costs or expenses whatsoever, but not including charges that are added to the price by a lessor on account of the tax imposed by this chapter or on account of any other tax imposed on the lessee for the lease or rental of personal property. The term “lease price” or “rental price” shall exclude separately stated charges not for the use of personal property. If any separately stated charge is not optional, it shall be presumed unless proved otherwise that it is part of the charge for the use of the personal property.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The “lease price” or “rental price”, in the case of a nonpossessory computer lease, includes all charges for the use of the computer's hardware, computer software, computer programs and databases for any purpose whether or not the charge for use is measured by the actual amount of time used or by some other measure.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>A transfer of the use or ownership of personal property, or a provision of a service, that is ancillary to a nonpossessory computer lease shall be deemed a separate transaction for purposes of determining whether the charge for the transfer or the service is includible in the lease or rental price of the nonpossessory computer lease only if the transfer or service is optional. The charge for a transfer or service that is not optional shall be included in the lease or rental price of the underlying nonpossessory computer lease, even if a separate charge for the transfer or service is stated in a contract or invoice. A transfer or service shall be considered optional for this purpose only if the lessee could have obtained the same nonpossessory computer lease from the same lessor without the transfer or service.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>L.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Lessee” means any person who leases or rents personal property from another, whether the lease or rental price is paid by the lessee or by another person.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>M.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Lessor” means any person, including the assignee of any lease or rental agreement, who leases or rents personal property to users.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>N.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Membership organization” means a corporation or other person that is organized on a membership basis. A person that is wholly owned by members of a membership organization, and that is operated primarily to furnish goods, services or facilities to members of the organization, shall be deemed a membership organization, its owners shall be deemed its members, and the membership organization and the deemed membership organization shall be treated as a member of the other. A person having trading privileges on an exchange that either is a membership organization, or is directly or indirectly owned 100 percent by a membership organization, shall be treated as a member of the membership organization. The term “membership organization” does not include an organization whose primary purpose is to sell or lease personal property to persons who do not manage the organization, have the right to elect management, or have trading privileges on the organization.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>O.<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Passenger automobile” means a “larger passenger automobile” or “smaller passenger automobile” as those terms are used in the City's “wheel tax” ordinance, chapter 3-56 of this Code.</p>

Prepaid telephone calling arrangements include the recharge of a prepaid calling arrangement. For purposes of this section, “recharge” means the purchase of additional prepaid telephone or telecommunications services whether or not the purchaser acquires a different access number or authorization code. “Prepaid telephone calling arrangement” does not include an arrangement whereby the service provider reflects the amount of the purchase as a credit on an account for a customer under an existing subscription plan.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(N)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>“Sale at retail” means the transmitting, supplying or furnishing of telecommunications and all services rendered in connection therewith for consideration: (1) to persons other than the city, federal government, state governments and state universities created by statue; and (2) other than between a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, or between the wholly owned subsidiaries, but only when the tax previously has been paid to a retailer and the gross charge made by one such corporation to another such corporation is not greater than the gross charge paid to the retailer for their use or consumption and not for resale.</p>

For air-to-ground systems and the like, “service address” shall mean the location of a taxpayer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent.</p>

As used in this chapter, “private line” means a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other specified locations.</p>

Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered “telecommunications” subject to the tax imposed under this chapter.</p>
