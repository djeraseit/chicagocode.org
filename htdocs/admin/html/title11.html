In designing the service, the city shall consider the following: costs; waste reduction potential; recycling capacity of affected residents; quality of materials collected; and ease of access to the service. The regular recycling service goal shall be achieved in stages, as follows:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(1)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>By July 1, 1992, no less than two-thirds of the households in low-density dwellings shall have regular recycling service.</p>

To further the purposes of this chapter, the department may utilize such persons to provide regular recycling service and, where appropriate, provide financial or other assistance to expand such activities to assist in the creation of new recycling facilities and operations.</p>

However, prior to substituting post-collection separation for regular recycling service in a particular area, the city or its contractors must have implemented at least two source separation and collection methods within a period of no less than 12 months, conducted an extensive recycling promotional campaign in the area, consulted with operators of private for-profit and nonprofit collection services, and provided an opportunity for the public to comment on any proposed substitution at a joint meeting of the city council economic development and energy, environmental protection and public utilities committees. Where the substitution of service occurs, the definition of regular recycling service shall be expanded to include post-collection separation for the purposes of meeting the above goals.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>(d)<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Where post-collection separation is used as a substitute for regular recycling service in a particular area, such separation facility shall recycle at least four categories of recyclable materials and utilize technology that has been demonstrated to be effective for the expected life of the facility.</p>

It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City of Chicago to promote programs that (1) reduce the amount of waste generated at the source; and (2) recover materials, for the purpose of recycling, that would otherwise be discarded and return them to the economy. Source- separation recycling is hereby recognized as the preferred method of recycling in the city.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>It is the purpose of this ordinance to achieve, at a minimum, the following recycling goals: 37.5 percent, by weight, for the entire city by 1996; 30 percent by weight, for commercial and office establishments by 1996; and 12 percent, by weight, for high density, condominium, and cooperative residential buildings by 1996, as specified in the City of Chicago's solid waste management plan. It is also the purpose of this ordinance to promote a 25 percent recycling goal for haulers and recycling service providers. Building owners, waste haulers, recycling service providers and building managers covered by this ordinance are required to implement recycling programs and are encouraged, wherever feasible, to implement programs which will exceed the above goals in order to further reduce the quantity of waste disposed, conserve natural resources and decrease operating costs.</p>
