<p class="p4"><b>PREFACE</b></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>This Code was reprinted in 2007 and is a codification of city ordinances of a general and permanent nature.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Numbering System</i></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of three (3) component parts separated by a hyphen, the figure before the hyphen representing the title number, the figure next after the hyphen representing the chapter and the figure after the hyphen indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Title 1 is numbered 1-4-010. Under this system each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 1-4 and 1-6 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 1-5. New chapters, articles and divisions may be included in the same way. Articles and divisions may also be placed at the end of the chapter or article where they belong.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Index</i></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Looseleaf Supplements</i></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplementation service. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof, as provided in the Adopting Ordinance.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Acknowledgments</i></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The city authorized the reprinting in 2006, and these volumes are issued as a replacement copy to replace all existing copies of the Code. The publisher is most grateful for the efforts of Tim Barton, John Bjork, Scott Burgh, Monica Carranza, Glenn Dempsey, Robert Dybas, Robert Fahlstrom, Vince Fontana, Jeff Levine, Rich Lewis, Peter Polacek, Pat Ryan, Elizabeth Scanlan, and Pete Ternes, all of whom participated in this project for the city. Additionally, the publisher is grateful for the efforts of the bureaus of plumbing, electrical, refrigeration, and ventilation, Laurie Dittman from MOPD, Javier Ceballos from DOE, and Richard Gregory from Vertex Elevator, all of whom reviewed the technical aspects of Title 18, Building Infrastructure. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.</p>

<p class="p4"><b>ADOPTING ORDINANCE</b></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><b>(Council Journal of 6-27-90, p. 17764)</b></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>Be It Ordained by the City Council of the City of Chicago:</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Section 1.</i> This ordinance, consisting of titles 1 through 17, inclusive, shall be known as the Municipal Code of Chicago and shall be treated as a new and original comprehensive ordinance, completely superseding the Municipal Code of Chicago adopted August 30, 1939, and subsequent code amendments adopted prior to February 28, 1990, with the exception of the Chicago Zoning Ordinance and amendments thereto.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Section 2.</i> The Corporation Counsel shall advise and assist the City Clerk in renumbering chapters and sections described in ordinances passed after February 7, 1990, amending the Municipal Code as then in effect, in order to assure that they comport with the numbering system of this Code. The revised numbers of those chapters and sections as determined by the City Clerk and the Corporation Counsel are hereby adopted for general use.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Section 3.</i> The Municipal Code of Chicago shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Section 4.</i> The City Clerk shall keep two copies of this Code. These copies shall be printed, pasted, or otherwise mounted on paper sufficiently thick and tough to withstand heavy usage, and preserved by the City Clerk in a book or binder in loose leaf form, or in such other form as the City Clerk may consider most expedient, so that all amendments to the code and all general ordinances hereafter passed may be inserted in their appropriate places in such volumes, and all sections of this Code or ordinances repealed from time to time may be extracted therefrom for the purpose of maintaining the two copies in such condition that they will show all general ordinances passed up to date at any time to serve as a current and ready reference.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>In determining whether any ordinance hereafter passed, or any part thereof, shall be inserted into the Code, and in determining the form, title, chapter and section in which it shall be inserted, the City Clerk shall be guided by the advice of the Corporation Counsel.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Section 5.</i> Revisions of this Code shall be prepared and published at intervals not exceeding six months to reflect any changes in the Municipal Code during such period.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Section 6.</i> No officer or employee except aldermen (as amended on its face) of the City shall issue or distribute as a publication of the City or any or its agencies, departments or officers any printed matter purporting to be an excerpt or quotation from this Code without first having submitted the printed matter to the Corporation Counsel for examination and approval as to form and accuracy.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Section 7.</i> Sufficient copies of this Code shall be deposited with the Municipal Reference Librarian for general public reference and use. Sufficient copies shall be distributed to the Mayor, the aldermen, the City Clerk, the City Treasurer and the heads of the various agencies and departments of city government for their respective use. With respect to any other person or entity, this Code shall not be considered a publication of the City for purposes of distribution pursuant to Section 2-64-110.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>The Mayor may reciprocate courtesies of other cities and governments by presenting to them a copy of this Code bound at City expense in such form as the Mayor deems suitable.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><i>Section 8.</i> Each section number of this Code shall consist of three component parts separated by dashes. The figure before the first dash shall refer to the title number; the figure following the first dash shall refer to the position of the chapter within a title; and the figure following the second dash shall refer to the position of the section within its chapter.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>No officer or employee except aldermen (as amended on its face) of the city shall issue any written material containing any section of the Municipal Code numbered differently than as numbered herein; and no section number shall be changed by any such officer or employee in drafting any amendment to this Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, the various departments and agencies of the city government may continue to use notices, citations and other documents containing references to chapter and section numbers of the Municipal Code as in effect prior to passage of this Code until December 31, 1990.</p>
