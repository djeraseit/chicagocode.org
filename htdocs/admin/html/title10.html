The designations of such restricted zones, which are described in subsection (b), are based upon the following considerations: (1) the aesthetic, historic or other distinguishing character of the areas so designated or their surrounding neighborhoods; (2) the safety of the public; and/or (3) the desire to avoid a proliferation of advertising benches in certain areas for reasons of aesthetics and public safety.</p>
